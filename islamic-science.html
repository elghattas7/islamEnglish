                                    <p>"A totally objective examination of it [the Qur'an] in the light of modern knowledge, leads us to recognize the agreement between the two, as has been already noted on repeated occasions. It makes us deem it quite unthinkable for a man of Muhammad's time to have been the author of such statements, on account of the state of knowledge in his day."</p>

                                <p>The goal in mentioning these scientific facts is not to tie every modern scientific breakthrough with a verse from the Qur'an. Rather, it is to clarify that there are verses in the Qur'an which contain accurate scientific information, which have only been discovered very recently by modern science. This affirms that the Qur'an is divine revelation from Allah.</p>
